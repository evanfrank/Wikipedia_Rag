    "Wikipedia is one of the largest repositories of human knowledge and offers a huge store of information to mine and use for everything from research to model development.

Due to the perishable nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[majuscule]] cursive, [[minuscule]] cursive, and semi-cursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles.

By the ninth century, the [[Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press.

      "15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form {{angbr|…ë}}, also called ''script a'', is often used in [[handwriting]]; it consists of a circle with a vertical stroke on its right. In the hands of medieval Irish and English writers, this form gradually developed from a 5th-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] {{angbr|œÑ}}.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}} The Roman form {{angbr|a}} is found in most printed material, and consists of a small loop with an arc over it.{{sfn|Diringer|2000|p=1}} Both derive from the majuscule form {{angbr|A}}. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. Graphic designers refer to the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms as ''single-decker a'' and ''double decker a'' respectively.\n",
